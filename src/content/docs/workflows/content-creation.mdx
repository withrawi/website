   ```

2. **Define Content Goals**

   ```bash
   rawi ask --act copywriter "Create content that educates and converts visitors to our API documentation"
   ```

3. **Provide Style Guidelines**
   ```bash
   rawi ask --act editor "Edit this content to match our brand voice: friendly, authoritative, but not overly technical" < draft.md
   ```

### Content Quality Assurance

```bash
# Multi-stage review process
quality_check() {
    local content="$1"

    # Grammar and style
    cat "$content" | rawi ask --act proofreader "Check for grammar, spelling, and style issues"

    # Fact verification

## Troubleshooting Content Creation

### Common Issues

**Writer's block:**

```bash
rawi ask --act creative-coach "I'm stuck writing about '$TOPIC'. Give me 5 different angles to approach this subject"
```

**Complex technical topics:**

```bash
rawi ask --act technical-writer "Explain this complex concept in simple terms that a general audience can understand" < technical-explanation.md
```

**Content length adjustment:**

```bash
# Expand content
rawi ask --act writer "Expand this outline into a detailed 2000-word article" < outline.md

# Condense content
rawi ask --act editor "Condense this article to 500 words while keeping key points" < long-article.md
```
