This guide shows how to use Rawi for research tasks, data analysis, and information synthesis.

## Overview

Rawi can assist with various research and analysis tasks:

- Information gathering and synthesis
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Competitive research
- Academic research assistance
- Market analysis
- Technical research

## Research Setup

### 1. Configure Research Profile

```bash
# Create a research-focused profile
rawi configure --profile research --provider anthropic --model claude-3-5-sonnet --temperature 0.2

# Academic research profile
rawi configure --profile academic --provider openai --model gpt-4 --temperature 0.1

# Data analysis profile
rawi configure --profile data-analysis --provider openai --model gpt-4 --temperature 0.3
```

### 2. Research Session Management

```bash
# Start a research session with a clear topic
rawi ask --new-session --act researcher "I'm researching the impact of AI on software development productivity"

# Continue with focused questions
rawi ask "What are the current metrics used to measure developer productivity?"
rawi ask "How do AI coding assistants affect these productivity metrics?"
```

```

**Conflicting findings:**

```bash
# Reconcile contradictions
cat conflicting-studies.txt | rawi ask --act meta-analyst \
    "Analyze why these studies have conflicting results and suggest how to reconcile the differences"
```

**Methodology selection:**

```bash
