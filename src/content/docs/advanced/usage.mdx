Learn the most effective ways to use Rawi through proven patterns, best practices, and advanced techniques that maximize productivity and AI assistance quality.

## Core Usage Patterns

### Question Formulation Patterns

#### Specific vs General Questions

**Instead of:**

```bash
rawi ask "Help with JavaScript"
```

**Use:**

```bash
rawi ask "How do I handle async/await errors in JavaScript when making API calls?"
```

**Pattern: Context + Specific Task + Technology**

```bash
rawi ask "In a React application, how do I optimize performance when rendering large lists of items?"
rawi ask "For a Node.js Express API, what's the best way to implement rate limiting for different user tiers?"
```

#### Progressive Question Patterns

**Start Broad, Get Specific:**

```bash
# 1. Overview
rawi ask --new-session "I want to implement user authentication in my web app"

# 2. Technology selection
rawi ask "Should I use JWT tokens or session-based auth for a React/Node.js app?"

# 3. Implementation details
rawi ask "Show me how to implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens"

# 4. Security considerations
rawi ask "What security best practices should I follow with this JWT implementation?"
```

### Template Selection Patterns

#### Task-Based Template Selection

**Code-Related Tasks:**

```bash
# File-based code review
rawi ask --file src/components/UserProfile.jsx --act code-reviewer "Review this React component for performance issues"

# Batch code analysis
rawi ask --batch "src/**/*.js" --act security-expert "Analyze all JavaScript files for security vulnerabilities"

# Architecture decisions
rawi ask --act software-architect "Design a scalable microservices architecture for e-commerce"

# Debugging assistance with file context
rawi ask --file src/utils/memory-intensive.js --act debugging-expert "Help me debug this memory leak in my Node.js application"
```

**Writing and Documentation:**

```bash
# Document source files directly
rawi ask --file src/api/routes.js --act technical-writer "Document this REST API endpoint with examples"

# Process documentation files
rawi ask --file requirements.docx --act copywriter "Create user onboarding emails based on these requirements"

# Generate comprehensive documentation
rawi ask --files src/models/*.js --act code-documenter "Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for all model files"

# Batch process documentation
rawi ask --batch "docs/**/*.md" --act editor "Review all documentation for consistency and clarity"
```

**Analysis and Research:**

```bash
# Data file analysis
rawi ask --file user-behavior.csv --act data-scientist "Analyze this user behavior dataset and find insights"

# Document analysis
rawi ask --file market-research.pdf --act business-analyst "Extract key findings about competitors in the project management software space"

## Error Handling and Recovery Patterns

### Graceful Degradation

```bash
# Primary attempt with error handling
cat complex-code.js | rawi ask --act code-reviewer "Comprehensive code review" 2>/dev/null || \
# Fallback to simpler analysis
cat complex-code.js | rawi ask "Quick code review - any obvious issues?"
```

### Retry Patterns

```bash
# Retry with exponential backoff
for i in {1..3}; do
    if output=$(rawi ask "Complex analysis question" 2>/dev/null); then
        echo "$output"
        break
    else
        echo "Attempt $i failed, retrying in $((i*2)) seconds..."
        sleep $((i*2))
    fi
done
```

## Integration Patterns

### Git Workflow Integration

```bash
# Pre-commit hook pattern
#!/bin/bash
# Check for TODO comments and get AI suggestions
git diff --cached | grep -i "TODO\|FIXME" | \
    rawi ask --act project-manager "Prioritize these TODO items and suggest immediate actions"

# Commit message generation
git diff --cached | rawi ask --act git-expert "Generate a clear, conventional commit message for these changes"
```

### CI/CD Integration Pattern

```bash
# Code quality gate
changed_files=$(git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only | grep -E '\.(js|ts|py)$')
for file in $changed_files; do
    score=$(cat "$file" | rawi ask --act code-quality-assessor "Rate this code quality from 1-10 and explain")
    if [[ "$score" =~ ^[1-5] ]]; then
        echo "Code quality concern in $file: $score"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### Monitoring Integration

```bash
# Intelligent alerting
while read -r alert; do
    echo "$alert" | rawi ask --act incident-responder "Assess this alert severity and suggest immediate actions" | \
    if grep -q "CRITICAL"; then
        # Send to on-call engineer
        mail -s "Critical Alert" oncall@company.com
    fi
done < alerts.log
```

## Best Practices Summary

### Question Quality

1. **Be Specific**: Include context, technology stack, and specific requirements
2. **Provide Examples**: Show what you've tried and what didn't work
3. **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous responses for deeper understanding

### Template Usage

1. **Match Expertise**: Choose templates that align with your task
2. **Combine Templates**: Use different templates for different aspects of a problem
3. **Learn Templates**: Explore `rawi act --list` regularly

### Session Management

1. **Stay Focused**: Keep sessions topic-focused for better context
2. **Use Descriptive Starts**: Begin sessions with clear context
3. **Reference Previous Work**: Build on earlier conversation points

### Profile Management

1. **Environment Separation**: Different profiles for work/personal/projects
2. **Provider Optimization**: Match providers to task complexity
3. **Cost Management**: Use appropriate models for different scenarios

### Integration

1. **Error Handling**: Always include fallback options in scripts
2. **Resource Limits**: Be mindful of input size and API limits
3. **Caching**: Cache common responses to improve performance

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Ineffective Question Patterns

**Too Vague:**

```bash
rawi ask "Fix my code"  # No context
```

**Too Broad:**

```bash
rawi ask "Teach me programming"  # Too general
```

**No Context:**

```bash
rawi ask "Why is this broken?"  # No code or error provided
```

### Poor Session Management

- Mixing unrelated topics in one session
- Starting new sessions for follow-up questions
- Not providing context in session continuations

### Inefficient Template Usage

- Using generic templates for specialized tasks
- Not exploring available templates
- Mixing expertise levels inappropriately
