# Rawi Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security patches for the **latest major version** of Rawi. While we recommend always using the most recent release for the best security and features, you can generally expect security updates for the currently active major release series.

For example, if the current major version is `v1.x.x`, security patches will be applied to this series. Older major versions are not actively supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security vulnerability within Rawi, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, please contact us **immediately and privately** via our [**security contact form**](https://rawi.mkabumattar.com/contact).

All security vulnerability reports will be promptly acknowledged, reviewed, and addressed. We kindly request that you give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure.

## Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a security vulnerability report, we will:

1.  **Acknowledge Receipt:** We will send an initial response acknowledging your report within **2-3 business days**.
2.  **Investigation and Remediation:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability and work on a fix.
3.  **Public Disclosure:** We aim to disclose the vulnerability publicly within **90 days** from the date of the initial report, or sooner if a fix is released and widely available. We will notify the reporter prior to public disclosure.

We adhere to coordinated vulnerability disclosure best practices.
